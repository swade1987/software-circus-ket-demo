# Software Circus KET Demo
A repository for my Kismatic Enterprise Toolkit (KET) demo at Software Circus Amsterdam (10th Jan 2017).

The repository uses [Packet.net](https://www.packet.net/) to provide the underlying infrastructure.

The following two projects are used to make this demo possible:

1. [Kismatic Enterprise Toolkit](https://github.com/apprenda/kismatic)

2. [Kismatic Provision](https://github.com/apprenda/kismatic-provision)

After provisioning the cluster the demo will show two pieces of KET functionality:

1. Ingress
2. Adding a new worker node

Follow the steps below to create the cluster and execute the ingress and add-worker demos.

# 1. Cluster creation
